## Project Overview
HomeAway Insights is a data-driven initiative that combines in-depth analysis and machine learning to pinpoint profitable real estate investment opportunities and to understand vacation-oriented market trends. Our project leverages historical data, tourist activity, economic indicators, and housing statistics to deliver strategic insights for real estate investors and companies like Prello.

### Data Analysis, Visualization, and dashboarding 
* Interactive visualizations to explore the distribution and key metrics of municipalities.
* Geographic visualizations on maps highlight the areas with high potential for vacation-oriented real estate investments.
